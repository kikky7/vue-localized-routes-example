# Vue Localized Routes Example

> Use vue-router in combination with vuex-i18n to get translated routes in you SPA applications

## Setup
```bash
git clone git@github.com:kikky7/vue-localized-routes-example.git
cd vue-localized-routes-example
npm install
run dev OR run watch-poll
```

## Run with PHP server
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

## Docs
The code for full route translations is little bit of a hack, because I didn't find any simpler way to set different route paths for different locales.

### Core code
```bash
assets/js/app.js
```

### Language switch code
```bash
assets/js/components/Navbar.vue
```
